Notes
=====
• To replicate these results it may be necessary to restart testrpc.
• One reason for that is that the refund and time out tests depend upon the project going over the minimum possible deadline time of 1 second from now at project creation time,
  while contributions are being added. On a fast computer, and depending where in the second creation occurred, the 1 second may not tick over before the refund tests start.
  If that happens try repeating the test run.
• The log results at the end above are for the FundingHub Owner loop to push 2 refunds after doing one pull refund.
  Other log entries were removed for final run because of how messily they appear vs the it() assert results.
